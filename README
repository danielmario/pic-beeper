Sources for a simple PIC (12F675) tutorial for driving a LED, 
a buzzer and using timer0 interrupts. Schematics included!

I use the Vdd self-starting circuit from the Microchip's 
Tips 'n Tricks Manual for simple and battery-concious usage, 
and the other pins (GP2 and GP5) to activate the LED and 
a small speaker (R_L).
